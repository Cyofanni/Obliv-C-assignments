		***Exact Proximity Testing***

** Problem description
Alice wants to know whether Bob is within a certain distance from her location (e.g., 2km), without publishing her own coordinates (same for Bob).

** Notes on the code
The code for this task has been divided into three source files: 
      - exact_prox_testing.c: it contains the usual sanity checks on the command line inputs, the parameter setting, 
	and finally some calls to Obliv-C library's functions, such as "setCurrentParty" and "execYaoProtocol" (used to call
	the function implementing the oblivious computation);
      - exact_prox_testing.h: here the struct "protocolIO" is defined. It contains two records, an array representing the latitude and the longitude
	of the current party, and an integer which will store the final result (0 or 1);
      - exact_prox_testing.oc: here the actual oblivious computation is performed. The coordinates are stored into four "obliv floats".
	Then the square of the euclidean distance is computed. In the end, the outcome is published and shared among parties in protocolIO's
	"res" variable.

** How to compile and run the assignment
In order to compile, run and test the code you should first clone this repository: https://github.com/samee/obliv-c.
Follow the instructions in the README to compile and install it.
Finally, put this folder (ASSIGNMENT_exact_prox_testing) under obliv-c/test/oblivc and run "make" inside it.
Some tests can be run thanks to the script named "tests.sh".
