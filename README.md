# Obliv-C-assignments
Assignments for a course about Secure Computation and Privacy issues in Social Networks (University of Padua, Master's degree in Computer Science).
The exercises make use of [Obliv-C](http://oblivc.org/), "a simple GCC wrapper that makes it easy to embed secure computation protocols inside regular C programs".
